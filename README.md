# YES-BANK-STOCK-CLOSING-PRICE-PREDICTION


Yes Bank is a popular bank in India. Since 2018, it has been in the news because of a fraud case involving its former CEO, Rana Kapoor. This made people curious about how the case affected the bankâ€™s stock prices. The dataset used here has the monthly stock prices of Yes Bank, including the opening, highest, lowest, and closing prices for each month. The main aim of this project is to predict the closing price of the stock for each month and check if time series or other prediction models can give accurate results.
