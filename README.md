# YES-BANK-STOCK-CLOSING-PRICE-PREDICTION


Yes Bank is a popular bank in India. Since 2018, it has been in the news because of a fraud case involving its former CEO, Rana Kapoor. This made people curious about how the case affected the bank’s stock prices. The dataset used here has the monthly stock prices of Yes Bank, including the opening, highest, lowest, and closing prices for each month. The main aim of this project is to predict the closing price of the stock for each month and check if time series or other prediction models can give accurate results.


# Conclusion

1. We trained three different regression models — Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

2. After training, we also fine-tuned the models using GridSearchCV.

3. Independent variables(input variable) have a very high influence on dependent variable(target variable).

4. The accuracy for each model is more than 95%.

5. Linear Regression is the best model for this dataset — it has the highest accuracy (R²) and the lowest error (MSE, RMSE).

6. While Random Forest and KNN also performed well, their prediction errors are slightly higher.
